This is my Node project using the SEQUEALIZE database, Here I just simply showed the basic things in this Project.
How to do Add/Delete/Edit products in the Websites as well as in the database also, I am showing this thing in this Project.



## SEQUEALIZE: -

It's a 3rd party package to be precise it's an Object Relational Mapping Library.

**ORM: -** Object Relational Mapping 

#### NOTE: -

After Upgrading the Sequealize version ```findById()``` was replaced by ```findByPk()```

When I did this project that's time I learned about JavaScript, NodeJs,
 ExpressJs, HTML, CSS, PUG, Handlebars, EJS, SQL and sequealize DataBase. One
  more thing Here **"npm"** is the most vital thing that's why I also go
